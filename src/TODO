> Turn BIG array of SDL_Rects into one of only monsternum every frame

~~~ Movement and timing ~~~

!DONE!	> Turn frame-based translations into time-based (for vastly easier rhythm making)
	> Possibly keep sprite animations frame-based -- maybe multiples of 30fps? Would mean game can run at 30x fps.	This would mean having some kind of time-based clock and a frame based clock.
	> Take animations out of level.c code and into some kind of organised function that finds the right animation frame -- maybe for each sprite have an "animation frame #" value, with an array of animation frame numbers that are pointers to the coordinates on the png?
